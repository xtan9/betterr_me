## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9-phase comprehensive structure derived from 29 requirements across 3 categories (Sidebar, Visual System, Testing)
- [Roadmap]: Dependency chain: token extraction -> sidebar shell -> page migration -> polish -> test stabilization
- [Roadmap]: E2E baselines deleted upfront (Phase 1), regenerated last (Phase 9) per research recommendation
- [01-01]: Primary accent updated from 160 84% 39% to Chameleon-extracted 157 63% 45% (less saturated, more professional)
- [01-01]: --background stays white, new --page token provides gray canvas (backward compatible)
- [01-01]: Dark mode uses blue-purple hue (240) with 4% lightness steps for elevation
- [01-01]: Sidebar variables renamed to --sidebar-background (shadcn v3 convention), raw HSL format

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~Research notes sidebar CSS tokens in globals.css use hsl() wrappers that need reformatting (Phase 1 scope)~~ RESOLVED in 01-01
- Background token split (--background vs --card) will reveal misuse of bg-background for elevated surfaces (Phase 1 audit)
- New tokens (--page, --highlight, sidebar) need registration in tailwind.config.ts (01-02 scope)
