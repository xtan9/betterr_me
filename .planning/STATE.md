## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9-phase comprehensive structure derived from 29 requirements across 3 categories (Sidebar, Visual System, Testing)
- [Roadmap]: Dependency chain: token extraction -> sidebar shell -> page migration -> polish -> test stabilization
- [Roadmap]: E2E baselines deleted upfront (Phase 1), regenerated last (Phase 9) per research recommendation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research notes sidebar CSS tokens in globals.css use hsl() wrappers that need reformatting (Phase 1 scope)
- Background token split (--background vs --card) will reveal misuse of bg-background for elevated surfaces (Phase 1 audit)
