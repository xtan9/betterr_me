# v3.0 Projects & Kanban — Milestone Audit (Final)

**Milestone:** v3.0 Projects & Kanban
**Audited:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** tech_debt — all requirements met, no critical blockers, accumulated process debt
**Scores:** Requirements 17/17 | Phases 4/5 verified | Integration 17/17 | Flows 8/8

## Audit History

| Date | Status | Score | Trigger |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| 2026-02-20 | gaps_found | 16/17 | Post-Phase 16 — PROJ-03 archive/restore broken by Zod validation |
| **2026-02-21** | **tech_debt** | **17/17** | **Post-Phase 17 — PROJ-03 fixed, all requirements satisfied** |

## Phase Verification Summary (4/5 verified)

| Phase | Status | Score | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| 13 — Data Foundation & Migration | passed | 14/14 | All 4 DATA requirements satisfied |
| 14 — Projects & Sections | passed | 11/11 | All 9 PROJ/FORM/PAGE requirements satisfied |
| 15 — Kanban Board | passed (human_needed) | 4/4 | All 4 active requirements; DnD needs browser testing |
| 16 — Integration Bug Fixes | **UNVERIFIED** | — | Missing VERIFICATION.md (process gap) |
| 17 — Fix Archive/Restore Validation | passed | 5/5 | PROJ-03 satisfied |

### Phase 16 Unverified — Mitigating Evidence

Phase 16 fixed 4 critical integration bugs but was never formally verified. All requirements mapped to Phase 16 have strong mitigating evidence:

- **PROJ-01, FORM-01, FORM-02, PAGE-01, PAGE-02:** Verified by Phase 14 VERIFICATION.md
- **KANB-02:** Verified by Phase 15 VERIFICATION.md
- **Integration checker (this audit):** All 17 requirements confirmed wired cross-phase; all 8 E2E flows complete

## Requirements Cross-Reference

### Source Availability

| Source | Available | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| VERIFICATION.md | 4/5 phases | Phase 16 missing |
| SUMMARY.md frontmatter (requirements-completed) | 0/12 plans | Field not populated in this milestone |
| REQUIREMENTS.md traceability | Complete | All 17 active + 3 deferred |

### Status Determination (2-Source: VERIFICATION + REQUIREMENTS.md)

| REQ-ID | Description | Assigned Phase | VERIFICATION | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final |

| DATA-01 | Migration: section=personal, status from is_completed | Phase 13 | SATISFIED (13) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DATA-02 | Status field: backlog/todo/in_progress/done | Phase 13 | SATISFIED (13) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DATA-03 | Bidirectional status/is_completed sync | Phase 13 | SATISFIED (13) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DATA-04 | Existing features unchanged after migration | Phase 13 | SATISFIED (13) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| PROJ-01 | Create project with name, section, color | Phase 16 | SATISFIED (14) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| PROJ-02 | Edit project name, color, section | Phase 14 | SATISFIED (14) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| PROJ-03 | Archive project (hidden, available via filter) | Phase 17 | SATISFIED (17) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| PROJ-04 | Delete project (tasks become standalone) | Phase 14 | SATISFIED (14) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| PROJ-05 | Project progress X/Y on card | Phase 14 | SATISFIED (14) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| FORM-01 | Section selector in task create/edit | Phase 16 | SATISFIED (14) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| FORM-02 | Project dropdown filtered by section | Phase 16 | SATISFIED (14) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| PAGE-01 | Tasks page shows Work/Personal sections | Phase 16 | SATISFIED (14) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| PAGE-02 | Section shows project cards + standalone tasks | Phase 16 | SATISFIED (14) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| PAGE-03 | Click project card opens kanban board | Phase 15 | SATISFIED (15) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-01 | 4-column kanban board for project tasks | Phase 15 | SATISFIED (15) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| KANB-02 | Drag-and-drop between columns changes status | Phase 16 | SATISFIED (15) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| I18N-01 | All UI strings translated in en/zh/zh-TW | Phase 15 | SATISFIED (15) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |

**Deferred (not in scope):** KANB-03, KANB-04, KANB-05 — documented in REQUIREMENTS.md Future Requirements with Phase 15 user decisions as rationale.

**Orphaned requirements:** None. All 17 active requirements appear in at least one phase VERIFICATION.md.

## Cross-Phase Integration (17/17 wired)

### Summary

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Exports consumed | 22 properly wired |
| Orphaned exports | 1 (getSortOrderBetween — intentional deferral) |
| API routes with callers | 8/8 |
| Auth-protected routes | 5/5 |
| Missing connections | 0 |
| Broken flows | 0 |

### E2E Flow Results (8/8 complete)

| # | Flow | Requirements | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Task create with section and project | FORM-01, FORM-02 | COMPLETE |
| 2 | View tasks page with section layout | PAGE-01, PAGE-02 | COMPLETE |
| 3 | Click project card → kanban board | PAGE-03 | COMPLETE |
| 4 | Drag card between kanban columns | KANB-01, KANB-02 | COMPLETE |
| 5 | Quick-add task in kanban column | KANB-01 | COMPLETE |
| 6 | Create/edit/delete project | PROJ-01, PROJ-02, PROJ-04 | COMPLETE |
| 7 | Archive and restore project | PROJ-03 | COMPLETE |
| 8 | Backward compatibility — dashboard, recurring tasks | DATA-03, DATA-04 | COMPLETE |

### Integration Observations

1. **`getSortOrderBetween` orphaned** — Phase 13 infrastructure for deferred KANB-03. No runtime impact.
2. **`archiveProject` DB method dead code** — Archive flows use `updateProject({status:'archived'})`. No functional impact.
3. **Client-side section filtering** — GET /api/tasks returns all tasks; SectionBlock filters locally. Design decision from Phase 14-02.
4. **Two fetcher patterns** — tasks-page-content uses inline fetcher; kanban-board uses shared lib/fetcher. Both correct.

## Tech Debt (7 items across 4 phases)

### Phase 16: Integration Bug Fixes
- Missing VERIFICATION.md (process gap — requirements verified by other phases)

### Phase 13: Data Foundation
- `getSortOrderBetween()` unused export (infrastructure for deferred KANB-03)

### Phase 14: Projects & Sections
- `archiveProject()` dead code convenience method
- `getUserTasks` orders by `created_at`, not `sort_order` (intentional — kanban sorts by priority)

### Phase 15: Kanban Board
- Comments/Activity placeholders in detail modal (intentional — future feature)
- No sidebar nav highlight on kanban page

### Process
- SUMMARY.md files lack `requirements-completed` frontmatter (2-source cross-reference only)

**Total:** 7 items. All minor/info severity. No blockers.

## Human Verification Items

From phase verification reports — require browser interaction, not blockers:

**Phase 13:** Migration SQL execution, toggle sync behavior
**Phase 14:** Section toggle clears project, dark mode colors, stopPropagation, Open Board nav, auth redirect
**Phase 15:** Drag-drop persistence, API failure rollback, quick-add SWR revalidation, detail modal layout
